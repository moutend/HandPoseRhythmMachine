# Hand Pose Rhythm Machine

A demo app that recognizes hand shapes using the Vision framework and plays sound effects.

## Requirements

- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 14.0+

## Usage

After launching the app, start by scanning the shape of a rock in rock-paper-scissors. Hold the iPhone in one hand and keep the other hand about 1 foot away from the iPhone.

If the hand shape scanning is progressing well, a sound effect will play. Once the rock shape is scanned, proceed to scan the shape of paper in the same manner.

When both the rock and paper shapes are scanned, the rhythm machine sounds will be activated. The rock shape will play a shaker sound, and the paper shape will play a clap sound. Alternate between them to create a beat!
